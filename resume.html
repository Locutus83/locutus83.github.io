            I am an experienced web developer that has worked in a number of different capacities including
            Customer Support, QA, Desktop Application Development, Backend API development, and full stack development.
            I have worked with many different languages including but not limited to: PHP, C#, Java, Javascript, and
            SQL.
            I do best when I can work with customers to better understand what they expect from the application; then
            use that improved understanding to craft the application to best suit their needs.
